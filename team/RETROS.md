# Retro 04/20/20

- Led by: Preetham Kesineni
- Present: Connor McIntosh, Edward Thai, Tomas Vera, Tristan Hernandez, Trung Bui

## Action item

- a goal: Being capable enough using Next.js to start the MVP of the project. Getting baseline code started.
- a change: Researching deeper into Next.js and looking into external libraries that may help our goal/project.
- a measurement: Having an inital project commit done on github. Having a review session for our understanding of next.js knowledge.

## Retro Assessment

- The Retro process I chose to use for this meeting is the Stop/Start/Continue framework. This involves initially discussing with the team what we would like to stop doing for the project, what we want to start applying, and what is working and should continue.
- The Retro was quick and efficient. We were able to as a group figure out what we believe is a more appropriate approach to completing our project efficiently.
- Advice I would give to the next person leading the retro is possibly trying a different framework. While I found this one to be efficient and effective with the project being so early on our team didn't have too much to discuss as far as stoping and starting. We mostly had the most to discuss on what we should continue.

## Action item

- a goal (at the end of 2nd iteration): Having a working database (MongoDB) abd incorporate more diverse range of charts.
- a change: Start working in smaller group (2 or less), allow flexibility in choosing issues to work on.
- a measurement: Keep track of the PRs rate.

Note:

Continue:
 - Working collaboratively, efficient with MVP, agreement + communication going swell, slack active, at least a person to review PRs
 - Spltting up workload effectively
Stop:
- So far no negatives...
- Assigning workload equally
- mob programming 
Start:
- Brainstorming ideas -> clarification on current ideas in icebox
- Split up a big issue to smaller ones (beneficial for individual work)
- More individual coding (group of 2 or less)
- If any question, ask team members for clarification
- Reviewing MongoDB and OAuth
